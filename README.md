# vacation-ornaments

## About

My husband and I have a tradition of buying a souvenir ornament every time we take a trip. We love this tradition and I wanted to make a simple page to keep them organized. This way, we can remember all the wonderful trips we've taken and why we picked the ornaments we did.

## Technologies used

- Vue 3 w/ Pinia
- Vite testing

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
